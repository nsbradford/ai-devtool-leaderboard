## 🎲 Chaotic Functions

We've added some... interesting utilities to `src/lib/utils.ts`:

- `getRandomEmoji()` - Returns a random emoji because why not
- `isTacoTuesday()` - Determines if it's Taco Tuesday (spoiler: it's always Taco Tuesday in your heart)
- `YELL(text)` - Makes text LOUD AND ANGRY
- `getMeaningOfLife()` - Returns 42 (obviously)
- `isNice(n)` - You know what this does ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

## 🔥 Chaos Generator

Run the chaos generator for daily terrible ideas:

```bash
tsx scripts/chaos-generator.ts
```

## 💡 Philosophy

This section of the codebase follows the ancient principle:

> "Move fast and break things, then break them some more, then maybe fix them later, or not."
> 
> — Ancient Developer Proverb

## ⚠️ Warnings

- Do not use this in production
- Do not show this to your manager
- Do not question the madness
- Do embrace the chaos

## 🎨 Contributing to Chaos

## 📜 The Chaotic Covenant

By reading this file, you agree to:
1. Never take code too seriously
2. Always leave things better (or weirder) than you found them
3. Sprinkle joy like confetti
4. Remember that bugs are just features with poor marketing

*May your code be buggy and your coffee be strong* ☕
