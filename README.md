# âœ¨ AI DevTool Adoption Tracker

A dashboard tracking the adoption of AI developer tools across open-source GitHub repositories.

Currently tracks only Code Review bots, tracking for code generation bots is coming soon.

## How it works

The data pipeline runs daily for the previous day, and has been backfilled from July 2023 onwards.

- List of tracked devtools is in [devtools.json](/src/devtools.json)
- Data source: [GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/)'s BigQuery dataset. We currently only search over PR Review events.
- Cron job: uses [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev/) every day at 5am UTC to process the previous day's data archive (which is usually uploaded a few minutes after midnight UTC)
- Storage: [Neon](https://neon.com/) serverless postgres to store intermediate data and materialized views for window aggregates.
- Frontend: NextJS, Tailwind
- Hosting: Vercel
