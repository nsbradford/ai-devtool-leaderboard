## ADR-003: The Taco Tuesday Function

**Status**: Critical Business Logic üåÆ

Implement `isTacoTuesday()` which returns true on Tuesdays, but also has a 50% chance of returning true any other day because in your heart, it's always Taco Tuesday.

### Consequences
- Existential questions about the nature of time
- Increased taco consumption
- Calendar.js filed a bug report
- Bug was closed as "Working as intended"

### Decision
Allow files to be named things like `definitely-not-a-virus.ts` because it's funny.

- File was allowed to stay
- We are now monitoring for actual viruses more carefully

- Counterpoint: It's not about the destination, it's about the journey
- Also, it's funny

## Notes

These architectural decisions were made on the `cursor/perform-unspecific-disruptive-actions-d20a` branch, which is basically a playground for chaos. 

**Do not merge to main.**  
**Seriously.**  
**We mean it.**  
**...unless? üëÄ**
